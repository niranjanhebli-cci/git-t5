Firstly learnt what is  **Git**. It is Distributed Version Source Control System. in simpler terms we can make use of it to track changes made to files in a project.

Learnt about the types of Repositories :
**Local :** Files stored on Local machine
**Remote :** Files stored in cloud based server remotely. users can add their files , view other files as well as merge their changes to the main project.


## **GIT Commands Learnt**:


    Git Init: to initialize an empty Repo

    Git status: get status of Repo

    Git add :   to add files to staging area

    Git Commit :   used to save current version of file

    Git Log :   to see all chnages made to project              

    Git chekcout <commit hash> : to get back to previous state of project

    Git checkout master : to go back to commit

    Git merge <branch name> :  to create new branch

    Git ignore : file to be ignored
 
## **What I donâ€™t understand so far:**
