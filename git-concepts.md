## Name: Shaun Steve Pereira
## Tech : Git 
## What I understood so far: 

- Git is version control system which helps developers to maintain changes in files and have mulitple version of a particular code, since there different verions of a particular file the developer can revert to the previous changes if he wants to. Git helps in collabrative work where multiple developers can work together and contribute to single file or repository.
- There are multiple commands in git few of the main ones which are often used are
    - `git init`: this is used to intialize git in a particular folder
    - `git commit`: this command is use to commit changes.
    - `git push`: this command is used to push the recent commited changes to the remote repository 
    - `git add`: adds files to the staging area.
    - `git pull`: its used to pull the recent changes done in the remote repository.
    - `git clone`: this command is used to clone or copy a remote repository to to your local repositories.
    - `git checkout`: this command is mostly used to switch between multiple branches in a repo.
    - `git branch branch_name`: this commmand is used to create a new branch.

## What I donâ€™t understand so far: 

- How to resolve any confilts if there are any in a particular branch
- How to use the `merge, stash, revert,rebase` command 
- I have not used the following commands and would like to learn about them:  
`revert`, `diff`, `stash`.
