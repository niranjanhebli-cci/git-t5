## Name: A Aravind Sagar
## Tech : Git 
## What I understood so far: 
- Git is a vital version control system that tracks changes in files and manages different versions of a project, making it indispensable for software development. It supports collaborative work by allowing multiple developers to contribute to a project simultaneously while maintaining a detailed changelog of all modifications. Iâ€™ve familiarized myself with Git through Git Bash, a command-line interface (CLI) that offers powerful control over Git's functionalities.

- I learned basic Git commands such as `fetch`, `pull`, `status`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, and `init`, which are essential for managing and updating a repository. Additionally, I practiced more advanced commands like `clone`, `branch`, `checkout`, and `merge`, which are crucial for branching strategies and integrating changes.
